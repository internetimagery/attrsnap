Incorporate distance as a dimension in the vector.

ie: (distance, attr1, attr2, att3, etc...)

Then use vector math to work out which way to go based on existing moves.

Perhaps project all positions onto a plane. Generate curve on that plane.
Then for each axis do the same (skipping the distance axis).
The convergeance point of all curves gives a prediction

could try:
take three points. order by distance.
get point in between closest two controlPoints
get vector from midpoint to furthest point
normal and scale by scalar
repeat!
