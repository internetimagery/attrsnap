Throw error if attribute is out of range at the beginning of matching. OR move it to the nearest range limit in one swoop.

add button to mute individual attributes. Would require an additional piece of info in snap files.

investigate if pulling some match code into go speeds things up.

add scroll window for very long attribute lists in main window and renaming window.

add option to keep existing keyframes and only modify anim-curve.
ie: bake out keys and run procedure that simplifies curve pushing and pulling tangents,
keeping original key times intact. may need to force weighted tangents, and broken tangents.

make a special case graphical error if attribute exists, but is unkeyable. OR just not allow unkeyable / locked attributes
but causing the same error for missing attributes as locked ones could be confusing.

add duplicate group option

consider a special case regex to run on attributes, that tries settings translates/rotates/scales
to the markers corresponding translate/rotate/scales. This does break the tools scope and introduces
a bit of feature creep however.

consider making special case marker syntax such as | to include more than one item.
the central point of all items would be used as the marker point. Useful for things like
an edgeloop of verts, matching to the center of the mesh.

consider adding offsets. Right now it's not nessisary as locators can be parented etc
but some situations are more difficult, such as offsets applied to vertex markers etc.
