Throw error if attribute is out of range at the beginning of matching. OR move it to the nearest range limit in one swoop.

add button to mute individual attributes. Would require an additional piece of info in snap files.

add subframe support

disable frame fields when auto is active

investigate if pulling some match code into go speeds things up.

add scroll window for very long attribute lists in main window and renaming window.

add option to keep existing keyframes and only modify anim-curve.
ie: bake out keys and run procedure that simplifies curve pushing and pulling tangents,
keeping original key times intact. may need to force weighted tangents, and broken tangents.

make a special case error if attribute exists, but is unkeyable. OR just not allow unkeyable / locked attributes
but causing the same error for missing attributes as locked ones could be confusing.

add duplicate group option
